# 💪 Hand Strength & 🛒 Purchase & Delivery System

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two Python-based object-oriented projects:

1. **Hand Strength Simulation** – Determines if a person can lift an object based on hand strength and total force.
2. **Purchase & Delivery System** – Simulates an e-commerce checkout process, allowing users to select different shipping methods.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Hand Strength Simulation
### 📖 Description
This program models a person's lifting ability, considering:
- Two individual hands with separate lifting capacities.
- A total body strength for lifting with both hands.
- User input to check if a given weight can be lifted.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🎭

### 🚀 How It Works
1. The user enters the lifting capacity for each hand and total body strength.
2. They input the weight of an object to check if it can be lifted.
3. The system determines if one or both hands are required or if lifting is impossible.

### 📌 Example
```shell
Enter left hand lifting capacity: 5
Enter right hand lifting capacity: 6
Enter total lifting strength: 12
Enter the weight of the object (or -1 to exit): 4
➡️ Can lift with the left hand.
```

## 🛍️ Purchase & Delivery System
### 📖 Description
This system simulates a shopping experience where users:
- Select a product with a price.
- Choose a shipping method with different costs and delivery times.
- Calculate the final price including shipping.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- OOP & Polymorphism 🎭

### 🚀 How It Works
1. The user selects a product and price.
2. They choose from different shipping methods:
   - Standard (cheaper, slower)
   - Express (faster, more expensive)
   - Custom (variable price based on distance)
3. The system calculates and displays the final cost and estimated delivery time.

### 📌 Example
```shell
Enter product name: Laptop
Enter product price: 1000
Choose shipping method (Standard, Express, Custom): Express
➡️ Total Cost: $1050 | Estimated Delivery: 2 Days
```
